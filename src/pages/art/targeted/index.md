A website animation of cascading circles using randomized colors. This project is intended to be shown simultaneously on multiple devices.

Our screens are broadcasting devices, available for targeted surveillance either by companies seeking to advertise products or our government.

These interventions highlight the proliferation of available devices in the public sphere and our personal lives.

The implementation of the work requires taking over devices found in a location, rendering them unusable for the duration of the piece.
